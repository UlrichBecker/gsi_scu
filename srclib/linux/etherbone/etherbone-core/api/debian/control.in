Description: serial protocol for the Wishbone bus - development files
 The Wishbone bus is an open bus standard used in system-on-chip projects.
 It is a memory mapped interconnect which aggregates pipelined slaves. Each
 slave is enumerated and described by meta-data found inside the SoC.
 .
 This library provides a C API suitable for use on Linux, Windows, and
 embedded devices. See etherbone.h for API documentation. The API is
 non-blocking, but if no callback is provided it will internally block
 requests upon termination of a cycle.
 .
 Development files for building an application dependent on this library.
