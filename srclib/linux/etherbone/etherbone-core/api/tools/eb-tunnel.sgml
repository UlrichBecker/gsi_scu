    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a program that provides a gateway
      (proxy) which bridges Etherbone traffic from TCP to UDP. It can be
      used to set up a server, that acts as a bridge between a standard
      Ethernet network and a White Rabbit network.
    </para>

    <para>
      The mandatory parameter &lt;proxy-port&gt; specifies the IP port this
      program listens to.
    </para>

      <title>EXAMPLE</title
    <para>
      Assume a White Rabbit node with Wishbone architecture has a network
      interface with IP 192.168.47.11 and is connected to a White Rabbit network.
    </para>

    <para>
      Use eb-tunnel on a computer "host1" that is connected to the standard
      Ethernet network as well as the White Rabbit Network. On that
      computer: "eb-tunnel 123456".
    </para>

    <para>
      Now one is able to communicate to the White Rabbit node from another
      computer "host2" on the standard Ethernet nework.
      Example "eb-ls tunnel/host1/123456/192.168.47.11".
    </para>
